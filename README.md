### Installation instructions
#### PHP Client
1. Download the source code and copy the content of the directory to your prefered location
2. Edit the ```config.inc.sample.php``` file to setup access to your database and rename to ```config.inc.php``` :
```php
	$_config['sql_type']          // database type 'mysql' (MySQL/MariaDB) or 'sqlite'
	$_config['sql_host']          // sql server hostname (only needed for 'mysql')
	$_config['sql_user']          // sql server username (only needed for 'mysql')
	$_config['sql_pass']          // sql server username password (only needed for 'mysql')
	$_config['sql_db']            // database name or SQLite filename
	$_config['sql_prefix']        // table prefix (only needed for 'mysql')
	
	$_config['default_accuracy']  // default maxymum accuracy for location record to be displayed on the map
	
	$_config['enable_geo_reverse'] // set to TRUE to enable geo decoding of location records
	$_config['geo_reverse_lookup_url'] // geodecoding api url, will be appended with lat= & lon= attributes 
```
3. Create datatable using schema_mysql.sql or schema_sqlite.sql (in the 'sql' directory)

4. Setup authentication using a copy of .htaccess.sample.
Create password file outside public folder by using
/path/to/htpasswd -c /etc/htpasswd/.htpasswd user1

the -c is used to create a new file.
